                    With skills in over 4 different fields of design, I am the perfect person to hire when it comes to a
                    full fledged project. Whatever your needs are, I can pretty much take on any challenge.

                        Working at Facebook has taught me a lot about how to understand users, solve problems and build

                        My experience at dribbble has helped me learn to develop the eye for design. Colors, typography,

                        I started my design journey with motion design in my college days. Motion is something that really
                        fascinates me because of the flexibility of story telling.

                        Clicking pictures really brings out the creative in me. Phtography really makes you look and
                        percieve things in a different way.
